## Benchmarking Spatial-Aware Classification Models for Urothelial Cancer Subtypes Using Cardinal


Our project aims to establish a benchmark for distinguishing muscle-invasive from non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancer using MSI data. By developing an accurate and robust model for urothelial cancer subtype classification, we aim to optimize the allocation of medical resources, improve patient care, and enhance clinical outcomes. The dataset consists of 49 bladder tissue samples obtained from 47 patients, which represent various diagnoses of urothelial cancer, including muscle-invasive, non-muscle-invasive, and related conditions. MSI data was pre-processed and labeled on the European Galaxy server for transparency and reproducibility. All data are publicly available in the Proteomics IDEntifications Database under project code PXD026459. Our preliminary exploratory analysis shows marked variation in the spatial patterns across the tissue microarrays, with clear segregation between tumor and stromal tissues. Characteristic peaks are present within the mass spectra, especially in the low m/z range, indicating the range of different biomolecules that could be important in distinguishing cancer types. 

The scope of our project is to develop a classification model using the Spatial Shrunken Centroids (SSC) algorithm, along with other machine learning approaches such as Partial Least Squares (PLS) classification, Random Forest,  and, if time permits, XGBoost. To address the issue of imbalanced cancer subtypes, we implement the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), which duplicates examples from the minority class. By comparing SSC with traditional machine learning models, we aim to demonstrate the advantages of spatial-aware algorithms in MSI-based cancer classification. These findings could support more accurate cancer identification and improved treatment strategies.
